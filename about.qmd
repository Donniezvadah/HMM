# About the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) Course

This site presents a **rigorous, proof-oriented course on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**. It is designed for:

- Graduate students in statistics, machine learning, or applied mathematics
- Researchers and advanced practitioners who want a mathematically honest treatment of HMMs
- Instructors who need a reference set of lecture-style notes and problem sets

The course emphasizes **calm clarity** over flash: clean typography, high-contrast math, and a modular layout so you can move between foundations, algorithms, theory, and applications without friction.

## Pedagogical Philosophy

- **Theory-first, but example-driven.** Core results are stated and proved, with pointers to Zucchini et al. and more advanced monographs.
- **Separation of concerns.**
  - Section 0–1: probability and Markov chains
  - Section 2–3: model construction and likelihoods
  - Section 4–5: algorithms and estimation
  - Section 6–9: asymptotic theory and advanced variants
  - Section 10–11: applications and proof-based problem sets
- **Notation stability.** Notation is aligned as much as possible with Zucchini, MacDonald & Langrock to make cross-reading easy.

## Who Should Use This Material

You will benefit most if you:

- Are comfortable with undergraduate probability and linear algebra
- Are willing to engage with proofs and derivations (not just code)
- Want to connect HMM algorithms to broader ideas in stochastic processes and statistical inference

If your background is lighter, start with **Section 0 (Mathematical Prerequisites)** and use the references to fill any gaps.

## How This Site Is Structured

- **Home page:** Quick overview, value proposition, and module view of the course.
- **Overview (HMM.md):** A textual syllabus with references and links to all sections.
- **Sections 0–11:** Each section is a self-contained set of notes with definitions, theorems, and proof sketches.
- **Resources & Help:**
  - `About` (this page): context and intended audience
  - `FAQ`: practical questions on using the notes
  - `Contact`: how to suggest corrections or improvements

## Primary References

This course is intentionally compatible with:

- Zucchini, MacDonald, Langrock – *Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R*.
- Cappé, Moulines, Rydén – *Inference in Hidden Markov Models*.
- Douc, Moulines, Stoffer – *Nonlinear Time Series: Theory, Methods and Applications*.
- Rabiner (1989) – *A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition*.

You can treat these notes as a **bridge** between the applied style of Zucchini et al. and the more measure-theoretic style of Cappé–Moulines–Rydén.
