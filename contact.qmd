# Contact & Feedback

This HMM course site is designed as a living set of notes. Care has been taken to keep the mathematics and notation consistent, but **typos and gaps can still occur**.

## How to Provide Feedback

Because this project is intended to be hosted from a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub), the recommended feedback channels are:

- **Issues:** Open an issue on the course repository describing:
  - The section (e.g., "Section 4 – Inference"),
  - The line or equation where the problem occurs,
  - A brief description of the error or suggested clarification.
- **Pull requests (advanced users):** If you are comfortable editing Markdown/Quarto, you can propose a fix directly and submit a pull request for review.

If you are using these notes in a private setting (not yet on GitHub), you can adapt this page with your preferred contact method (e.g., an academic email address or institutional LMS).

## What Kind of Feedback Is Most Helpful?

- **Mathematical corrections:** Incorrect statements, missing assumptions, or unclear proofs.
- **Notation issues:** Inconsistencies with Zucchini et al. or between sections.
- **Clarity improvements:** Places where a short additional remark, example, or reference would significantly help understanding.
- **Typos and formatting:** Misrendered equations, broken links, or layout glitches.

## A Note on Response Times

This site is intended as a resource rather than a commercial platform. Response times for issues or pull requests may vary. When hosted publicly, you can check the repository’s issue tracker to see the status of open items.

If you are adapting these notes for your own course, feel free to fork the repository and modify them to suit your audience, while keeping appropriate attribution to the original references.
