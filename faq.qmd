# Frequently Asked Questions

## What background do I need?

You should be comfortable with:

- Undergraduate probability (random variables, conditional probability, basic limit theorems)
- Linear algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, basic spectral theory)
- Basic calculus and real analysis

Section 0 is designed to refresh **measure-theoretic language** just enough to make later sections precise.

## Is this course focused on R code?

No. While the **notation** is aligned with Zucchini et al. (who use R for examples), these notes are **language-agnostic**. The emphasis is on:

- Mathematical formulation of HMMs
- Algorithms (forward–backward, Viterbi, EM) at the level of formulas and proofs
- Statistical theory (consistency, asymptotic normality, identifiability)

You can implement the algorithms in any language (R, Python, Julia, C++, etc.).

## How should I study using this site?

A suggested path:

1. Read the **home page** and **HMM overview** to understand the big picture.
2. Work through **Sections 0–1** carefully if you are not fully comfortable with Markov chains.
3. Read **Sections 2–3** to understand the formal HMM model and likelihood.
4. Spend time with **Sections 4–5**, doing the derivations and proofs yourself.
5. Use **Sections 6–9** on a second pass for deeper statistical theory and advanced models.
6. Attempt problems from **Section 11** as if they were exam questions.

## Are there solutions to the problem sets?

No solutions are included here. The problems in Section 11 are intended for:

- Graduate coursework and qualifying exams
- Reading groups and self-study

Instructors can prepare their own solution sets or ask students to present solutions.

## How long does the course take?

As a rough guide:

- A 12–14 week semester course could spend **1–2 weeks per major block** (Foundations, Model & Inference, Estimation, Theory, Advanced Models, Applications/Problems).
- An intensive reading course could compress the material into **8–10 weeks** for well-prepared students.

## Can I use these notes for teaching?

Yes, subject to whatever license you choose when publishing the repository. Typical uses:

- As a core set of lecture notes, supplemented with your own examples and code.
- As a reading list for graduate seminars.
- As background material for research students working on time-series or latent variable models.

If you use the notes in a course, consider adding a short remark in your syllabus pointing students to the site and to the primary references.

## How do I report errors or suggest improvements?

See the **Contact** page for how to propose corrections or enhancements once the site is hosted (e.g., via GitHub issues or a simple contact form).
